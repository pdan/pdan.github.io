          <h3 class="title">Programmer!?</h3>
          <p>
            Since the beginning of my journey in the IT industry, I’ve had a clear and focused goal - to learn as much
            as I can, keep pushing myself, and make things that I can take pride in. Which is why I don’t limit myself
            as a programmer, designer, or any other resource having a specified skillset. I’ve learnt everything I know
            on the job, under immense work pressures, and am continuing to do so. From design to front-end coding,
            product requirements, solve linux web server problems. Where people normally see challenges, I see
            opportunities.
          </p>

            A self-taught client & server-side developer working on cutting-edge technologies and currently
            specializing
            in in single-page web applications. Involved in the entire life cycle of product development, right from
            designing the solution architecture, selecting the appropriate client & server-side frameworks, assigning
            weekly sprints and finally writing code for the features I take up myself.

          <h3 class="title">Where do i see myself after a few years?</h3>
          <p>
            I have big dreams. It’s that simple. I see all these ideas and potential in me and I just want to try and
            live upto it. I don’t have a fancy degree or a brand’s recognition on my resume, but I have the desire, the
            ambition, the right work ethic & the talent to be good in what I do.
            Ideally, I’d like to be working on a great product and adding value with my creativity, marketing ideas,
            innovator and technical knowledge. Or I may decide to take the pledge and startup with one of my ideas and
            try to change the world, one step at a time.
