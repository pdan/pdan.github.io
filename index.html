          <h3 class="title">What is my life about?</h3>
          <p>
            I believe life is full of beauty, and I always try to find it. I love to explore the physical and spiritual aspects of our world, and learn new things that can help me create something better and more enjoyable. I feel happy when I see people benefit from my work, and I look for unique and unexpected opportunities that I can pursue and share with others.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">What do I do and what will I do?</h3>
          <p>
            I am a self-taught developer, who can work on both client and server-side, and build single-page web applications with the latest technologies. I am also a creative and passionate product and UI/UX designer, who can create cross-platform apps and experiences. My technical skills and strong imagination allow me to come up with better features, solve more problems, pay more attention to detail, and design products that offer an amazing user experience. I can handle the whole design and development process, from conceptualizing product features, identifying the target audience, creating wireframes and prototypes, designing the UI, to launching the product.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">Am I a programmer or a designer?</h3>
          <p>
            I don't limit myself to just programming, designing, or any other skill set. Since I started my career in the IT industry, my goal has been to learn as much as possible, challenge myself, and create things I can be proud of. I have learned everything I know on the job, under extreme work conditions, and I will keep learning. I am good at design, front-end coding, product requirements, Linux web server issues, and more. I don't see obstacles, I see opportunities.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title">Where do I see myself in a few years?</h3>
          <p>
            I have big dreams. It's that simple. I have the potential and ideas to achieve them and I am determined to make them happen. I may not have a fancy degree or a famous brand on my resume, but I have the drive, ambition, work ethic, and talent to excel in what I do. My ideal situation would be to work on a great product, using my creativity, marketing ideas, innovation, and technical knowledge to add value. Or, I might decide to take a risk and start one of my own ideas, and make a positive change step by step.
