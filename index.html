          <h3 class="title">How my life is going on?</h3>
          <p>
            Life is more beautiful than what we see in a glance. I try to see and understand the beauties in the world by my
            the energy I get from challenges and sophistications everyday and every moment.
            Therefore, I need to travel to each part of the world (physical world or psychic world) to experience those
            beauties and achive more information about the world to create new things which I need to live better
            and enjoy more. I  have a liking for watching people  using and benefiting from my achievements. So I'm crazy about finding new weird things and develop them to bring them to my
            life and other people to take pleasure more.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">What I'm doing and gonna do?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a self-taught client and server-side developer working on cutting-edge technologies and currently
            specializing
            in single-page web applications. 

            I'm an innovative and enthusiastic Product and UI/UX Designer proficient in creating cross platform apps and
            experiences.
            Vast technical expertise combined with strong imaginative skills enables me to ideate better features,
            solve
            more problems, give higher attention to details, and design products that deliver an exceptional
            experience.
            I have involved in the entire design and develop process, from visualizing product features, determining the target audience,
            visualizing UX flows, creating wireframes and prototypes, designing the UI to finally releasing the product.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title">A programmer or a designer!?</h3>
          <p>
            Since the beginning of my journey in the IT industry, I’ve had a clear and focused goal - to learn as much
            as I can, keep pushing myself, and make things that I can take pride in. Which is why I don’t limit myself
            as a programmer, designer, or any other resource having a specified skillset. I’ve learnt everything I know
            on the job, under immense work pressures, and am continuing to do so. From design to front-end coding,
            product requirements, solve linux web server problems or employ. Where people normally see challenges, I see
            opportunities.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title">Where do i see myself after a few years?</h3>
          <p>
            I have big dreams. It’s that simple. I see all these ideas and potential in me and I just want to try and
            live upto it. I don’t have a fancy degree or a brand’s recognition on my resume, but I have the desire, the
            ambition, the right work ethic and the talent to be good in what I do.
            Ideally, I’d like to be working on a great product and adding value with my creativity, marketing ideas,
            innovator and technical knowledge. Or I may decide to take the pledge and startup with one of my ideas and
            try to change the world, one step at a time.
